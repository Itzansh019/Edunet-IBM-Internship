# 🎓 College Admission Agent (RAG-Based AI) – Built with IBM Watsonx.ai Studio

Welcome to the smart way of handling college admissions!  
This project is an AI-powered agent that helps students navigate the often confusing admission process — from course selection to fee queries — using natural conversations and real-time document understanding.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

This AI agent acts like a 24/7 digital admission guide.  
Students can ask questions like:
- *“What is the eligibility for B.Tech?”*
- *“When is the last date to apply for MBA?”*
- *“How much is the annual fee for BCA?”*

The agent instantly replies using real information retrieved from official documents — thanks to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered by **IBM Watsonx.ai** and **IBM Mistral-Large**.

## 💡 Why This Project?

Admissions can feel overwhelming for students and repetitive for admin teams.  
This project solves both problems by:
- Reducing manual workload
- Delivering real-time, reliable information
- Creating a smooth and transparent experience for everyone involved
